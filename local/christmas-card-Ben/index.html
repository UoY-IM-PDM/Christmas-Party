        <h1>Interactive Christmas Card</h1>
        <h2>How To Play</h2>
        <p>The objective of the game is to look after your snowman.</p>
        <h3>Money</h3>
        <p>Money is needed to buy clothes or equipment. You can make more money by playing minigames.</p>
        <h3>Temperature</h3>
        <p>You need to keep the temperature at 0 ℃ or less, otherwise the snowman will begin to melt (lose HP). You can regulate the temperature by buying and maintaining equipment.</p>
        <h3>Insulation</h3>
        <p>Use clothes to keep the snowman insulated. Different clothes have different insulation values. By insulating the snowman, it will lose health more slowly and regain health more quickly.</p>
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>The snowman loses HP if the temperature is above 0 ℃, and regains HP at 0 ℃ and below. If the snowman reaches 0 HP, he will die forever.</p>
