 ## How To Play
  The objective of the game is to look after your snowman.

  ### Money
   Money is needed to buy clothes or equipment. You can make more money by playing minigames.

  ### Temperature
   You need to keep the temperature at 0 ℃ or less, otherwise the snowman will begin to melt (lose HP). You can regulate the temperature by buying and maintaining equipment.

  ### Insulation 
   Use clothes to keep the snowman insulated. Different clothes have different insulation values. By insulating the snowman, it will lose health more slowly and regain health more quickly.

  ### Health
   The snowman loses HP if the temperature is above 0 ℃, and regains HP at 0 ℃ and below. If the snowman reaches 0 HP, he will die forever.
